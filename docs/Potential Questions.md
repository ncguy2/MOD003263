# FUNCTIONAL

* How many applications would need to be reviewed in a session?
* What sort of data would need to be seen when reviewing an application?
* Where the data came from?
* What happens to the data post review?
* Will there need to be an admin control panel?
* What Platform will you be running the program on?


# USABILITY

* Would the templates need to be categorised at all?
* Would accessibility options, such as accounting for colour blindness, or text scaling, be necessary?
